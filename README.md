## UI Testing with XCUITest
Learn how to write automated UI testing in iOS using the XCUITest framework built into Xcode 16. Follow along as we use a demo project to test various functionalities, such as verifying item displays, removing items, and adding new items through interactive buttons, all while addressing common issues like test flakiness and brittleness. Learn how to set up, write, and optimize UI tests for long-term utility, including best practices for using accessibility identifiers and writing good assertion. Additionally, understand how to manage and execute these tests efficiently using Xcode's test plans and parallelization options.
